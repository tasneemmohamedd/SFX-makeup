    <p>SFX makeup is an abbreviation for (<i><b>special effects makeup</b></i>). It's really known in the hollywood life

  as it helps movie stars to be fake injured instead of being real injured.

  SFX makeup needs alot of patience , like alot, to get the perfect result . Its a kinda hard job

but if you like doing stuff with your hands , i think it'll be perfect for you. Sfx makeup isn't really that hard

 i mean if you wanna learn how to do it ,it'll be easy for you (as in the simple wounds).</p>

  <p>Sfx makeup isn't really known in the normal teen or adult life , which makes it a weird and unique job at the same time.
   Some teens nowdays know how to do sfx makeup without any help , i mean it can be really that easy for some of us or an enjoyable hobby.</p>

<h2>What does a sfx makeup artist do?</h2>
<hr>
<p>A skilled SFX artist is a master of using cosmetic products to create

   wounds, lesions, cuts, blood, physical abnormalities, alien species and much more.

  SFX artists help bring to life creatures and characters that simply don’t exist in the physical world,

  and will often work with a team of other creatives to ensure the finished product meets all the requirements of a project brief or other collaboration.

  A SFX artist must be familiar with colour theory, human and animal anatomy (even the most fantastical creatures are based on some reality)

  and how to create realistic molds for prosthetics. They are essential to a character’s development and need to be able to apply makeup

 consistently each day during production to ensure consistency.</p>
<br>

 <h2>What skills and education are required for a sfx makeup artist?</h2>
 <hr>
 <p>In addition to the skills mentioned above, an SFX artist needs to have an educational background .

 Of course, cosmetology is an asset as it is a thorough knowledge of the many different products that are used to achieve a particular look.

  You need to understand how to work with materials such as latex, foam, scar wax, fake blood and other materials to ensure what you produce is believable to the audience.

   These artists are excellent communicators and have a knack for solving problems on the fly.</p>

   <h2>How i became a basic small SFX makeup artist</h2>
   <hr>
    <p>Yes, i do know how to do sfx makeup, im a beginner though.

   Learning sfx makeup wasn't really that hard for me,as i enjoyed doing stuff with my hands,

   i  discovered it at the age 13 i guess, the first wound i ever did was with uhu glue

   i was bored , and then this idea popped in my head that i want to try doing fake wounds.

   Without any hesitation i grabbed the glue and started applying it on my hand, until it dried and

   formed a burn effect . Then i grabbed my mom's old brown/red lipsticks and started adding some to

   the wound and started blending them together until they were perfectly blended.</p>

   <p>You're probably wondering who inspired me or like how did i learn it.

   but actually no one inspired me to start this, i did not watch any tutorials , i just started

   going with what was in my mind and it ended as a wound.</p>
