        <h3><dt>Scar wax:</dt></h3>
          <dd>It's the fake skin you use instead of your hands, it's like a dough

        which you can make at home , it's made of white flour , vasline, and foundation

    that matches your skin color . Mix them all together until you get the desired result</dd>
    <hr>
    <h3><dt>Fake blood:</dt></h3>
    <dd>It's the fake blood you use, it can be made of honey and a little bit of red food coloring</dd>
    <hr>
    <h3><dt>Liquid latex:</dt></h3>
    <dd>It's literally like your skin , but it's a transparent liquid , that takes the skin color

 and it can be used with cotton if you want to cut it open.

It is typically applied using a disposable sponge and takes about five to ten minutes to dry depending

 on how thick it is applied. As it dries, it solidifies to a rubbery consistency and in the process ends up

 shrinking by approximately 3%.

 <h3><dt>Glue:</dt></h3>
 <dd> White glue or UHU glue can give you the result of a burning effect ,

you keep moving your hands up and down side to side until it forms a wrenckled shape.

To give you the burning color effect try using different shades of red eyeshadow,

or lipstick and blend it well.</dd>

 <h3><dt>The difference between liquid latex and scar wax:</dt></h3>
 <dd>They both can give the desired product , but they share alot of differences.
 <br>
<p>Liquid latex is a liquid that makes fake skin on your skin and to open it up you need to use cotton with it .

It also can be used on your eyes , and those sensitive parts of the body.</p>

<p>Scar wax is a litle bit different , its more like a soft smooth dough that you can spread on your skin using vasline

and it can be homemade while liquid latex can't .

Scar wax can be used on the hands as well as the liquid latex , but it can be hard to use it on your eyes.

For me i prefer using scar wax .</p>
